EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This proposal provides the reasoning and information needed to launch a nontechnical hackathon that encourages participants to utilize lean startup methodology to improve the University of Cincinnati. 
The purpose of this document is threefold:
1.	To provide context and reasoning that explains the benefit of a nontechnical hackathon.
2.	To outline the logistical details required to execute said event.
3.	To identify key partners necessary to make this event a success.
The project outline provides background information that explains my experiences within the hackathon. Furthermore it gives examples of solutions to problems on campus generated by other schools that undergo similar processes. 
The logistics of this event are heavily inspired by the model used by Startup Weekend & Kauffman Foundation. The event is designed to encourage momentum and foster innovation in participants.  
Finally, the key partners section of the document identifies segments of the University of Cincinnati that if engaged will significantly improve the quality of output from the event.
